## üöÄ Why I Built This

In my lab sessions, we often have to paste multiple output screenshots or experiment results into a Word document, adjust the layout manually, and print them. This process is:

- üïê Time-consuming  
- üìÑ Paper-wasting due to excess white space  
- üò© Repetitive and annoying every time

**So I made ImageFit PDF Maker** ‚Äî a quick tool that:

- Allows **bulk image uploads**
- **Auto-arranges images** with reduced gaps (choose layout size)
- Fits images optimally on A4 pages
- Exports them as a **lightweight, printable PDF**
- Has a mobile-friendly UI and dark/light aesthetic
