# üñºÔ∏è ImageFit PDF Maker

## Why I Built This

During lab sessions, we often had to paste multiple output screenshots or experiment results into a Word document, adjust the layout manually, and print them. This process is:

- Time-consuming  
- Paper-wasting due to excess white space  
- Repetitive and frustrating

**So I created ImageFit PDF Maker** ‚Äî a streamlined tool that:

- Allows **bulk image uploads**
- **Auto-arranges images** with reduced white space
- Fits images optimally on A4 pages
- Exports them as a **printable PDF**
- Offers a clean, responsive UI

- Choose layout size (1‚Äì4 images per row)  
- Optimized for A4 paper format  
- Preview PDF output on desktop  
- Download-ready on mobile  
- Reduces paper wastage by minimizing white space
